# üéµ Afrovibez Music Explorer

**Discover the heart of African music, one beat at a time.**

Afrovibez is a music discovery website that celebrates African artists and their incredible music. From the catchy Afrobeats of Nigeria to the soulful sounds of Senegal, this platform helps you explore artists and musical styles from across Africa.

## ‚ú® What This Project Does

This website is all about making it easy and fun to discover new African music. I built it because I love African music and wanted to create something that would help others discover amazing artists they might not know about yet.

### Why I Built This

Growing up listening to artists like Wizkid, Burna Boy, and Diamond Platnumz, I realized there's so much incredible African music that deserves more recognition. This website is my way of celebrating these artists and helping people discover new favorites.

## üöÄ Features

### **Find Your Next Favorite Artist**
- **Search Function**: Type in an artist name, music style, or country to find what you're looking for
- **Filter by Country**: Want to explore music from a specific African country? Just select it from the dropdown
- **Beautiful Artist Cards**: Each artist gets their own card with their photo, genre, and country

### **Smooth and Modern Design**
- **Glass-like Effects**: The website has a modern, translucent look that's easy on the eyes
- **Colorful Theme**: Inspired by African sunsets with purple, gold, and cyan colors
- **Works on Your Phone**: The website looks great whether you're on a computer, tablet, or phone
- **Interactive Elements**: Cards move and light up when you hover over them

### **Learn About Artists**
- **Detailed Pop-ups**: Click on any artist to see more information about them
- **Listen Links**: Direct links to streaming platforms so you can start listening right away
- **Artist Stats**: See how many fans they have and how many albums they've released

### **Smart and Reliable**
- **Always Works**: Even if the main data source is down, the website still shows some artists
- **Fast Loading**: The website loads quickly and runs smoothly
- **User-Friendly**: Clear messages let you know what's happening (like when search results are loading)

## üõ† How It's Built

This website uses three main building blocks:

- **HTML**: The structure and content of the website
- **CSS**: All the styling, colors, and animations that make it look good
- **JavaScript**: The interactive parts that make everything work (like search and filters)

The artist information is stored in a simple file called `db.json` that the website reads from.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run This Project

### What You Need First

You'll need to have Node.js installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Getting Started

1. **Download the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Iregno/Afro-vibez.git
   cd Afro-vibez
   ```

2. **Install the helper tool:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server
   ```

3. **Start the data server:**
   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
   ```
   
   This creates a simple server that provides artist data to the website.

4. **Open the website:**
   
   Simply double-click on `index.html` or open it in your web browser.

5. **Start exploring:**
   
   The website should now be working! Try searching for artists or filtering by country.

### How the Code Works

The main JavaScript file (`index.js`) contains a class called `AfrovibezApp` that handles:
- Loading artist data
- Searching and filtering
- Showing artist details in pop-ups
- Handling user interactions

The styling file (`styles.css`) creates:
- The modern glass-like appearance
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- The colorful African-inspired theme

## üé® Design Inspiration

The design is inspired by:
- **African Culture**: Rich purples and golds that represent African royalty and tradition
- **Modern Technology**: Glass-like effects that show the blend of tradition and innovation
- **Vibrant Energy**: Bright, energetic colors that capture the spirit of African music

### User Experience

The website is designed to be:
- **Easy to Use**: Simple navigation and clear buttons
